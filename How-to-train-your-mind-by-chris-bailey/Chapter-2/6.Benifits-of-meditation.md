# Benifits of meditation

- It makes us more mindful because of which are able to focus more deeply and get back on track once we lose focus. A research shows that whatever work is in front of us, we focus on it for only 53% of time. The rest of the time our mind is wandering. With meditation, We start noticing your thoughts, become focused for longer and our mind wanders for shorter durations and we get back on track very quickly as we notice our mind has derailed.

- Expands our brain's working memory capacity. This means we are able to hold and process more information.

- It makes our mind less stimulated. The rason we fall victim to distractions is our mind rewards us for paying attention to distractions by releasing dopamine. We get hits of dopamine each time we open our email, twitter or instagram. When we meditate, we make our mind less stimulated.

- It helps us with the tasks we more likely procrastinate on.
