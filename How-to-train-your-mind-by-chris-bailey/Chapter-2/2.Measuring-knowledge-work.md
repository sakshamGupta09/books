# Measuring productivity for knowledge work

Knowledge work means the tasks that you perform with your mind rather than simple repititive work you do with your hands.
That means you actually think for a living like computer programmers, scientists and pharmacyst.

Measuring knowledge work can be challenging.

Measuring productivity for physical work is simple. If you work in a factory and produce ten widgets instead of five, you are twice as productive. The faster and harder we work, more productive we become.

This equation doesn't hold true for knowledge work. In fact by working harder and faster on knowledge work, we can often accomplish less then you would working slower and more deliberately. Knowledge work benifits more from deeper thinking than it does from speed. It's aided more by creativity.
