# How meditation conditions our minds

By meditating you become more mindful automatically.

Our mind automatically and compulsively produces thoughts im response to the situations happening around us, most of which are counter productive.
When we meditate, we start noticing our thoughts and we keep doing it for rest of the day as well. As a result we do not get caught up in them and they cannot take us for a ride.
This is how meditation conditions our mind.
We also begin to notice very quickly when we are distracted and our mind has started wandering.
